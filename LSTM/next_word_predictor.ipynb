it good.\"\n\"nine cubits was the length thereof and four cubits the breadth of it after the cubit of a man.\"\n\"let him go and return to his house lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate it.\"\n\"let him also go and return unto his house lest he die in the battle and another man eat of it.\"\n\"let him go and return unto his house lest he die in the battle and another man take her.\"\n\"let him go and return unto his house lest his brethrens heart faint as well as his heart.\"\n\"for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.\"\n\"what meaneth the heat of this great anger.\"\n\"is not he thy father that hath bought thee.\"\n\"hath he not made thee and established thee.\"\n\"let them rise up and help you and be your protection.\"\n\"and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee and thou shalt tread upon their high places.\"\n\"and from whence come ye.\"\n\"and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.\"\n\"why tarry the wheels of his chariots.\"\n\"will ye save him.\"\n\"he that will plead for him let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning if he be a god let him plead for himself because one hath cast down his altar.\"\n\"is not this the people that thou hast despised.\"\n\"and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress.\"\n\"why therefore did ye not recover them within that time.\"\n\"we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.\"\n\"is it not so.\"\n\"what is this that thou hast done unto us.\"\n\"thou hast mocked me these three times and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.\"\n\"and what makest thou in this place.\"\n\"and what hast thou here.\"\n\"be not slothful to go and to enter to possess the land.\"\n\"now therefore consider what ye have to do.\"\n\"and whence comest thou.\"\n\"are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands.\"\n\"would ye stay for them from having husbands.\"\n\"and when thou art athirst go unto the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn.\"\n\"and where wroughtest thou.\"\n\"blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee.\"\n\"turn aside sit down here.\"\n\"and why eatest thou not.\"\n\"and why is thy heart grieved.\"\n\"put away thy wine from thee.\"\n\"for there hath not been such a thing heretofore.\"\n\"tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place.\"\n\"when he had wrought wonderfully among them did they not let the people go and they departed.\"\n\"and to whom shall he go up from us.\"\n\"this same shall reign over my

few sheep in the wilderness.\"\n\"what is mine iniquity.\"\n\"and what is my sin before thy father that he seeketh my life.\"\n\"it is not so.\"\n\"or what if thy father answer thee roughly.\"\n\"what hath he done.\"\n\"give me five loaves of bread in mine hand or what there is present.\"\n\"shall this fellow come into my house.\"\n\"be it far from me let not the king impute any thing unto his

days that break away every man from his master.\"\n\"wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king.\"\n\"for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord.\"\n\"or what evil is in mine hand.\"\n\"and let one of the young men come over and fetch it.\"\n\"should it not be with the heads of these men.\"\n\"and whence art thou.\"\n\"but as his part is that goeth down to the battle so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff they shall part alike.\"\n\"knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end.\"\n\"how long shall it be then ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren.\"\n\"wilt thou deliver them into mine hand.\"\n\"and what is my house that thou hast brought me hitherto.\"\n\"why then didst thou not go down unto thine house.\"\n\"knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall.\"\n\"why went ye nigh the wall.\"\n\"thou didst fast and weep for the child while it was alive but when the child was dead thou didst rise and eat bread.\"\n\"wilt thou not tell me.\"\n\"but hold now thy peace my sister he is thy brother regard not this thing.\"\n\"be courageous and be valiant.\"\n\"for the king doth speak this thing as

was their captain howbeit he attained not unto the first three.\"\n\"or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies while they pursue thee.\"\n\"or that there be three days pestilence in thy

and go to their master.\"\n\"out of the barnfloor or out of the winepress.\"\n\"look when the messenger cometh shut the door and hold him fast at the door is not the sound of his masters feet behind him.\"\n\"wherefore came this mad fellow to thee.\"\n\"turn thee behind me.\"\n\"turn thee behind me.\"\n\"now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance but deliver it for the breaches of the house.\"\n\"hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their own piss with you.\"\n\"and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high.\"\n\"and from whence came they unto thee.\"\n\"for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it.\"\n\"for thou knowest thy servant.\"\n\"are not his servants come unto thee for to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land.\"\n\"why then doth my lord require this thing.\"\n\"and hath he not given you rest on every side.\"\n\"for all things come of thee and of thine own have we given thee.\"\n\"so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams the same may be a priest of them that are no gods.\"\n\"and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen.\"\n\"and in thine hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee.\"\n\"for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon thee.\"\n\"forbear why shouldest thou be smitten.\"\n\"were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand.\"\n\"wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us so that there should be no remnant nor escaping.\"\n\"this is nothing else but sorrow of heart.\"\n\"and when wilt thou return.\"\n\"will ye rebel against the king.\"\n\"will they fortify themselves.\"\n\"will they sacrifice.\"\n\"will they make an end in a day.\"\n\"will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned.\"\n\"or shall they be sold unto us.\"\n\"and what is thy request.\"\n\"it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.\"\n\"and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request.\"\n\"even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.\"\n\"and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request.\"\n\"and it shall be performed even to the half of the kingdom.\"\n\"now what is thy petition.\"\n\"and it shall be granted thee or what is thy request further.\"\n\"and it shall be done.\"\n\"thou hast blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land.\"\n\"and still he holdeth fast his integrity although thou movedst me against him to destroy him without cause.\"\n\"but who can withhold himself from speaking.\"\n\"or where were the righteous cut off.\"\n\"shall a man be more pure than his maker.\"\n\"they die even without wisdom.\"\n\"or loweth the ox over his fodder.\"\n\"or is there any taste in the white of an egg.\"\n\"or is my flesh of brass.\"\n\"and is wisdom driven quite from me.\"\n\"but what doth your arguing reprove.\"\n\"cannot my taste discern perverse things.\"\n\"are not his days also like the days of an hireling.\"\n\"and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him.\"\n\"and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind.\"\n\"can the flag grow without water.\"\n\"or seest thou as man seeth.\"\n\"and should a man full of talk be justified.\"\n\"and when thou mockest shall no man make thee ashamed.\"\n\"deeper than hell what canst thou know.\"\n\"and the mouth taste his meat.\"\n\"and it should be your wisdom.\"\n\"and talk deceitfully for him.\"\n\"or as one man mocketh another do ye so mock him.\"\n\"and his dread fall upon you.\"\n\"make me to know my transgression and my sin.\"\n\"and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble.\"\n\"not one.\"\n\"or with speeches wherewith he can do no good.\"\n\"or wast thou made before the hills.\"\n\"and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself.\"\n\"what understandest thou which is not in us.\"\n\"is there any secret thing with thee.\"\n\"and he which is born of a woman that he should be righteous.\"\n\"he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.\"\n\"or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest.\"\n\"and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation.\"\n\"as for my hope who shall see it.\"\n\"mark and afterwards we will speak.\"\n\"and shall the rock be removed out of his place.\"\n\"oh that they were printed in a book.\"\n\"and if it were so why should not my spirit be troubled.\"\n\"and what profit should we have if we pray unto him.\"\n\"and how oft cometh their destruction upon them.\"\n\"seeing he judgeth those that are high.\"\n\"and where are the dwelling places of the wicked.\"\n\"they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.\"\n\"and who shall repay him what he hath done.\"\n\"or is it gain to him that thou makest thy ways perfect.\"\n\"will he enter with thee into judgment.\"\n\"and thine iniquities infinite.\"\n\"and behold the height of the stars how high they are.\"\n\"can he judge through the dark cloud.\"\n\"and what his soul desireth even that he doeth.\"\n\"and upon whom doth not his light arise.\"\n\"or how can he be clean that is born of a woman.\"\n\"and the son of man which is a worm.\"\n\"how savest thou the arm that hath no strength.\"\n\"and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is.\"\n\"and whose spirit came from thee.\"\n\"but the thunder of his power who can understand.\"\n\"and where is the place of understanding.\"\n\"and where is the place of understanding.\"\n\"was not my soul grieved for the poor.\"\n\"and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity.\"\n\"and did not one fashion us in the womb.\"\n\"we cannot be satisfied.\"\n\"for he giveth not account of any of his matters.\"\n\"my wound is incurable without transgression.\"\n\"or who hath disposed the whole world.\"\n\"and wilt thou condemn him that is most just.\"\n\"for they all are the work of his hands.\"\n\"and when he hideth his face who then can behold him.\"\n\"or if thy transgressions be multiplied what doest thou unto him.\"\n\"or what receiveth he of thine hand.\"\n\"no not gold nor all the forces of strength.\"\n\"if a man speak surely he shall be swallowed up.\"\n\"declare if thou hast understanding.\"\n\"or who hath stretched the line upon it.\"\n\"or hast thou walked in the search of the depth.\"\n\"or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death.\"\n\"declare if thou knowest it all.\"\n\"or because the number of thy days is great.\"\n\"or who hath begotten the drops of dew.\"\n\"and the hoary frost of heaven who hath gendered it.\"\n\"canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth.\"\n\"or who hath given understanding to the heart.\"\n\"or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve.\"\n\"or knowest thou the time when they bring forth.\"\n\"or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass.\"\n\"or will he harrow the valleys after thee.\"\n\"or wilt thou leave thy labour to him.\"\n\"or wings and feathers unto the ostrich.\"\n\"hast thou clothed his neck with thunder.\"\n\"the glory of his nostrils is terrible.\"\n\"wilt thou condemn me that thou mayest be righteous.\"\n\"or canst thou thunder with a voice like him.\"\n\"or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down.\"\n\"or bore his jaw through with a thorn.\"\n\"will he speak soft words unto thee.\"\n\"wilt thou take him for a servant for ever.\"\n\"or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens.\"\n\"shall they part him among the merchants.\"\n\"or his head with fish spears.\"\n\"whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.\"\n\"or who can come to him with his double bridle.\"\n\"his teeth are terrible round about.\"\n\"many are they that rise up against me.\"\n\"how long will ye love vanity and seek after leasing.\"\n\"who hast set thy glory above the heavens.\"\n\"and the son of man that thou visitest him.\"\n\"why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble.\"\n\"for ever.\"\n\"how long wilt thou hide thy face from me.\"\n\"how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me.\"\n\"who shall dwell in thy holy hill.\"\n\"cleanse thou me from secret faults.\"\n\"why art thou so far from helping me and from the words of my roaring.\"\n\"or who shall stand in his holy place.\"\n\"him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.\"\n\"shall it declare thy truth.\"\n\"rescue my soul from their destructions my darling from the lions.\"\n\"therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.\"\n\"my hope is in thee.\"\n\"and why art thou disquieted in me.\"\n\"and why art thou disquieted within me.\"\n\"and why art thou disquieted within me.\"\n\"for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.\"\n\"arise cast us not off for ever.\"\n\"ye shall be slain all of you as a bowing wall shall ye be and as a tottering fence.\"\n\"through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.\"\n\"they are utterly consumed with terrors.\"\n\"why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture.\"\n\"shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever.\"\n\"pluck it out of thy bosom.\"\n\"and will he be favourable no more.\"\n\"doth his promise fail for evermore.\"\n\"hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies.\"\n\"can he provide flesh for his people.\"\n\"wilt thou be angry for ever.\"\n\"shall thy jealousy burn like fire.\"\n\"let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed.\"\n\"wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations.\"\n\"shall the dead arise and praise thee.\"\n\"or thy faithfulness in destruction.\"\n\"and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness.\"\n\"why hidest thou thy face from me.\"\n\"or to thy faithfulness round about thee.\"\n\"wilt thou hide thyself for ever.\"\n\"shall thy wrath burn like fire.\"\n\"shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave.\"\n\"even according to thy fear so is thy wrath.\"\n\"and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.\"\n\"and thy thoughts are very deep.\"\n\"and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves.\"\n\"he that formed the eye shall he not see.\"\n\"he that teacheth man knowledge shall not he know.\"\n\"or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity.\"\n\"in wisdom hast thou made them all the earth is full of thy riches.\"\n\"who can shew forth all his praise.\"\n\"by taking heed thereto according to thy word.\"\n\"when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me.\"\n\"it is my meditation all the day.\"\n\"yea sweeter than honey to my mouth.\"\n\"or what shall be done unto thee thou false tongue.\"\n\"how great is the sum of them.\"\n\"or the son of man that thou makest account of him.\"\n\"and the scorners delight in their scorning and fools hate knowledge.\"\n\"when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep.\"\n\"and understanding put forth her voice.\"\n\"but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good.\"\n\"and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver.\"\n\"he pursueth them with words yet they are wanting to him.\"\n\"he shall stand before kings he shall not stand before mean men.\"\n\"for riches certainly make themselves wings they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.\"\n\"who hath sorrow.\"\n\"who hath contentions.\"\n\"who hath babbling.\"\n\"who hath wounds without cause.\"\n\"who hath redness of eyes.\"\n\"and he that keepeth thy soul doth not he know it.\"\n\"and shall not he render to every man according to his works.\"\n\"eat so much as is sufficient for thee lest thou be filled therewith and vomit it.\"\n\"there is more hope of a fool than of him.\"\n\"there is more hope of a fool than of him.\"\n\"who hath gathered the wind in his fists.\"\n\"who hath bound the waters in a garment.\"\n\"who hath established all the ends of the earth.\"\n\"what is his name and what is his sons name if thou canst tell.\"\n\"and their eyelids are lifted up.\"\n\"and what the son of my womb.\"\n\"and what the son of my vows.\"\n\"for her price is far above rubies.\"\n\"it hath been already of old time which was before us.\"\n\"even that which hath been already done.\"\n\"as the fool.\"\n\"what hath the poor that knoweth to walk before the living.\"\n\"for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun.\"\n\"for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.\"\n\"and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing.\"\n\"a mans wisdom maketh his face to shine and the boldness of his face shall be changed.\"\n\"behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains skipping upon the hills.\"\n\"how much better is thy love than wine.\"\n\"and the smell of thine ointments than all spices.\"\n\"what is thy beloved more than another beloved that thou dost so charge us.\"\n\"whither is thy beloved turned aside.\"\n\"that we may seek him with thee.\"\n\"the joints of thy thighs are like jewels the work of the hands of a cunning workman.\"\n\"ye will revolt more and more the whole head is sick and the whole heart faint.\"\n\"it was full of judgment righteousness lodged in it but now murderers.\"\n\"for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.\"\n\"it shall be ill with him for the reward of his hands shall be given him.\"\n\"for the living to the dead.\"\n\"to whom will ye flee for help.\"\n\"and where will ye leave your glory.\"\n\"or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it.\"\n\"as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up or as if the

dealt very treacherously.\"\n\"or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him.\"\n\"and whom shall he make to understand doctrine.\"\n\"them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts.\"\n\"doth he open and break the clods of his ground.\"\n\"add ye year to year let them kill sacrifices.\"\n\"and who knoweth us.\"\n\"when thou shalt cease to spoil thou shalt be spoiled and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously they shall deal treacherously with thee.\"\n\"who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings.\"\n\"where is the receiver.\"\n\"where is he that counted the towers.\"\n\"hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their own piss with you.\"\n\"and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high.\"\n\"and from whence came they unto thee.\"\n\"or what likeness will ye compare unto him.\"\n\"have ye not heard.\"\n\"hath it not been told you from the beginning.\"\n\"have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth.\"\n\"there is no searching of his understanding.\"\n\"he gave them as the dust to his sword and as driven stubble to his bow.\"\n\"yea there is none that sheweth yea there is none that declareth yea there is none that heareth your words.\"\n\"who will hearken and hear for the time to come.\"\n\"for they would not walk in his ways neither were they obedient unto his law.\"\n\"and the things that are coming and shall come let them shew unto them.\"\n\"ye are even my witnesses.\"\n\"who hath told it from that time.\"\n\"and who hath brought up these.\"\n\"let us stand together who is mine adversary.\"\n\"let him come near to me.\"\n\"lo they all shall wax old as a garment the moth shall eat them up.\"\n\"and where is the fury of the oppressor.\"\n\"for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken.\"\n\"and your labour for that which satisfieth not.\"\n\"hearken diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good and let your soul delight itself in fatness.\"\n\"against whom make ye a wide mouth and draw out the tongue.\"\n\"are ye not children of transgression a seed of falsehood.\"\n\"wherefore have we afflicted our soul and thou takest no knowledge.\"\n\"a day for a man to afflict his soul.\"\n\"is it to bow down his head as a bulrush and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him.\"\n\"to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free and that ye break every yoke.\"\n\"when thou seest the naked that thou cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh.\"\n\"this that is glorious in his apparel travelling in the greatness of his strength.\"\n\"are they restrained.\"\n\"wilt thou hold thy peace and afflict us very sore.\"\n\"and where is the place of my rest.\"\n\"who hath seen such things.\"\n\"or shall a nation be born at once.\"\n\"but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit.\"\n\"is he a homeborn slave.\"\n\"why is he spoiled.\"\n\"all they that seek her will not weary themselves in her month they shall find her.\"\n\"a land of darkness.\"\n\"yet my people have forgotten me days without number.\"\n\"therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways.\"\n\"shall not that land be greatly polluted.\"\n\"will he keep it to the end.\"\n\"she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree and there hath played the harlot.\"\n\"for we are spoiled.\"\n\"for my soul is wearied because of murderers.\"\n\"thou hast stricken them but they have not grieved thou hast consumed them but they have refused to receive correction they have made their faces harder than a rock they have refused to return.\"\n\"for the day goeth away for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.\"\n\"your burnt offerings are not acceptable nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.\"\n\"shall he turn away and not return.\"\n\"they hold fast deceit they refuse to return.\"\n\"every one turned to his course as the horse rusheth into the battle.\"\n\"is not her king in her.\"\n\"why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered.\"\n\"for they be all adulterers an assembly of treacherous men.\"\n\"we are greatly confounded because we have forsaken the land because our

travail.\"\n\"then may ye also do good that are accustomed to do evil.\"\n\"wilt thou not be made clean.\"\n\"when shall it once be.\"\n\"yea both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.\"\n\"why hast thou smitten us and there is no healing for us.\"\n\"we looked for peace and there is no good and for the time of healing and behold trouble.\"\n\"or can the heavens give showers.\"\n\"therefore we will wait upon thee for thou hast made all these things.\"\n\"or who shall bemoan thee.\"\n\"or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest.\"\n\"wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar and as waters that fail.\"\n\"or what is our iniquity.\"\n\"let it come now.\"\n\"or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken.\"\n\"for they have digged a pit for my soul.\"\n\"or who shall enter into our habitations.\"\n\"did not thy father eat and drink and do judgment and justice and then it was well with him.\"\n\"is he a vessel wherein is no

small and the shekel great and falsifying the balances by deceit.\"\n\"would they not have stolen till they had enough.\"\n\"if the grapegatherers came to thee would they not leave some grapes.\"\n\"how are his hidden things sought up.\"\n\"and whence comest thou.\"\n\"what is thy country.\"\n\"and of what people art thou.\"\n\"for the sea wrought and was tempestuous.\"\n\"when the morning is light they practise it because it is in the power of their hand.\"\n\"turning away he hath divided our fields.\"\n\"are these his doings.\"\n\"do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly.\"\n\"none evil can come upon us.\"\n\"is there no king in thee.\"\n\"is thy counsellor perished.\"\n\"for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.\"\n\"testify against me.\"\n\"mine eyes shall behold her now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.\"\n\"he retaineth not his anger for ever because he delighteth in mercy.\"\n\"and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger.\"\n\"his fury is poured out like fire and the rocks are thrown down by him.\"\n\"he will make an utter end affliction shall not rise up the second time.\"\n\"even cry out unto thee of violence and thou wilt not save.\"\n\"for spoiling and violence are before me and there are that raise up strife and contention.\"\n\"we shall not die.\"\n\"how long.\"\n\"and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay.\"\n\"was thine anger against the rivers.\"\n\"was thy wrath against the sea that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation.\"\n\"every one that passeth by her shall hiss and wag his hand.\"\n\"and how do ye see it now.\"\n\"is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing.\"\n\"and the prophets do they live for ever.\"\n\"corn shall make the young men cheerful and new wine the maids.\"\n\"the sword shall be upon his arm and upon his right eye his arm shall be clean dried up and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.\"\n\"and if ye offer the lame and sick is it not evil.\"\n\"offer it now unto thy governor will he be pleased with thee or accept thy person.\"\n\"neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought.\"\n\"why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother by profaning the covenant of our fathers.\"\n\"and who shall stand when he appeareth.\"\n\"for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him.\"\n\"it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men.\"\n\"do not even the publicans the same.\"\n\"do not even the publicans so.\"\n\"and in thy name have cast out devils.\"\n\"and in thy name done many wonderful works.\"\n\"art thou come hither to torment us before the time.\"\n\"but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them and then shall they fast.\"\n\"behold they that wear soft clothing are in kings houses.\"\n\"that they might accuse him.\"\n\"therefore they shall be your judges.\"\n\"and then he will spoil his house.\"\n\"for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.\"\n\"and who are my brethren.\"\n\"from whence then hath it tares.\"\n\"for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.\"\n\"or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul.\"\n\"bring him hither to me.\"\n\"of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute.\"\n\"of their own children or of strangers.\"\n\"for it must needs be that offences come but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh.\"\n\"if a man have an hundred sheep and one of them be gone astray doth he not leave the ninety and nine and goeth into the mountains and seeketh that which is gone astray.\"\n\"till seven times.\"\n\"and who gave thee this authority.\"\n\"from heaven or of men.\"\n\"for they all had her.\"\n\"whose son is he.\"\n\"for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.\"\n\"for ye devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayer therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.\"\n\"for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.\"\n\"for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone.\"\n\"for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess.\"\n\"for ye are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness.\"\n\"and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world.\"\n\"or thirsty and gave thee drink.\"\n\"or naked and clothed thee.\"\n\"for she hath wrought a good work upon me.\"\n\"it had been good for that man if he had not been born.\"\n\"what is it which these witness against thee.\"\n\"behold now ye have heard his blasphemy.\"\n\"see thou to that.\"\n\"art thou come to destroy us.\"\n\"what new doctrine is this.\"\n\"for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits and they do obey him.\"\n\"as long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.\"\n\"to save life or to kill.\"\n\"and how then will ye know all parables.\"\n\"and not to be set on a candlestick.\"\n\"or with what comparison shall we compare it.\"\n\"how is it that ye have no faith.\"\n\"the damsel is not dead but sleepeth.\"\n\"and what wisdom is this which is given unto him that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands.\"\n\"and are not his sisters here with us.\"\n\"go and see.\"\n\"perceive ye not yet neither understand.\"\n\"have ye your heart yet hardened.\"\n\"and having ears hear ye not.\"\n\"and do ye not remember.\"\n\"bring him unto me.\"\n\"tempting him.\"\n\"but ye have made it a den of thieves.\"\n\"and who gave thee this authority to do these things.\"\n\"answer me.\"\n\"he will come and destroy the husbandmen and will give the vineyard unto others.\"\n\"for the seven had her to wife.\"\n\"there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down.\"\n\"and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled.\"\n\"she hath wrought a good work on me.\"\n\"good were it for that man if he had never been born.\"\n\"couldest not thou watch one hour.\"\n\"what is it which these witness against thee.\"\n\"behold how many things they witness against thee.\"\n\"art thou come to destroy us.\"\n\"for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits and they come out.\"\n\"to save life or to destroy it.\"\n\"for ye have received your consolation.\"\n\"for ye shall hunger.\"\n\"for ye shall mourn and weep.\"\n\"for so did their fathers to the false prophets.\"\n\"for sinners also love those that love them.\"\n\"for sinners also do even the same.\"\n\"for sinners also lend to sinners to receive as much again.\"\n\"shall they not both fall into the ditch.\"\n\"or look we for another.\"\n\"or look we for another.\"\n\"and to what are they like.\"\n\"for he commandeth even the winds and water and they obey him.\"\n\"how readest thou.\"\n\"bid her therefore that she help me.\"\n\"or if he ask a fish will he for a fish give him a serpent.\"\n\"therefore shall they be your judges.\"\n\"for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets.\"\n\"for ye are as graves which appear not and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.\"\n\"for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.\"\n\"for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets and your fathers killed them.\"\n\"for ye have taken away the key of knowledge ye entered not in yourselves and them that were entering in ye hindered.\"\n\"give an account of thy stewardship for thou mayest be no longer steward.\"\n\"but where are the nine.\"\n\"or lo there.\"\n\"but now they are hid from thine eyes.\"\n\"or who is he that gave thee this authority.\"\n\"for seven had her to wife.\"\n\"and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass.\"\n\"for there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people.\"\n\"is not he that sitteth at meat.\"\n\"rise and pray lest ye enter into temptation.\"\n\"tell us.\"\n\"for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.\"\n\"and why do thoughts arise in your hearts.\"\n\"that we may give an answer to them that sent us.\"\n\"thou shalt see greater things than these.\"\n\"mine hour is not yet come.\"\n\"can he enter the second time into his mothers womb and be born.\"\n\"what dost thou work.\"\n\"thou hast the words of eternal life.\"\n\"hath no man condemned thee.\"\n\"even because ye cannot hear my word.\"\n\"and the prophets are dead whom makest thou thyself.\"\n\"how then doth he now see.\"\n\"how opened he thine eyes.\"\n\"will ye also be his disciples.\"\n\"for this man doeth many miracles.\"\n\"behold the world is gone after him.\"\n\"we cannot tell what he saith.\"\n\"and they smote him with their hands.\"\n\"whom seekest thou.\"\n\"follow thou me.\"\n\"or why look ye so earnestly on us as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk.\"\n\"and after it was sold was it not in thine own power.\"\n\"why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart.\"\n\"behold the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door and shall carry thee out.\"\n\"for his life is taken from the earth.\"\n\"of himself or of some other man.\"\n\"nay verily but let them come themselves and fetch us out.\"\n\"the multitude must needs come together for they will hear that thou art come.\"\n\"it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.\"\n\"thou that preachest a man should not steal dost thou steal.\"\n\"thou that abhorrest idols dost thou commit sacrilege.\"\n\"or what profit is there of circumcision.\"\n\"whose damnation is just.\"\n\"are we better than they.\"\n\"of works.\"\n\"when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision.\"\n\"shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace.\"\n\"for the end of those things is death.\"\n\"who shall deliver me from the body of this death.\"\n\"shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword.\"\n\"and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard.\"\n\"and how shall they hear without a preacher.\"\n\"how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out.\"\n\"or who hath been his counsellor.\"\n\"to his own master he standeth or falleth.\"\n\"or why dost thou set at nought thy brother.\"\n\"where is the scribe.\"\n\"where is the disputer of this world.\"\n\"and what hast thou that thou didst not receive.\"\n\"now if thou didst receive it why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it.\"\n\"do not ye judge them that are within.\"\n\"and if the world shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters.\"\n\"how much more things that pertain to this life.\"\n\"no not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren.\"\n\"why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded.\"\n\"know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body.\"\n\"for two saith he shall be one flesh.\"\n\"let him not become uncircumcised.\"\n\"let him not be circumcised.\"\n\"care not for it but if thou mayest be made free use it rather.\"\n\"seek not to be loosed.\"\n\"seek not a wife.\"\n\"who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof.\"\n\"or who feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock.\"\n\"or saith not the law the same also.\"\n\"and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar.\"\n\"that the idol is any thing or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing.\"\n\"are we stronger than he.\"\n\"have ye not houses to eat and to drink in.\"\n\"are all prophets.\"\n\"are all teachers.\"\n\"are all workers of miracles.\"\n\"do all speak with tongues.\"\n\"do all interpret.\"\n\"for ye shall speak into the air.\"\n\"when ye come together every one of you hath a psalm hath a doctrine hath a tongue hath a revelation hath an interpretation.\"\n\"or came it unto you only.\"\n\"why are they then baptized for the dead.\"\n\"let us eat and drink for to morrow we die.\"\n\"and with what body do they come.\"\n\"or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you.\"\n\"and what communion hath light with darkness.\"\n\"or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel.\"\n\"forgive me this wrong.\"\n\"walked we not in the same spirit.\"\n\"walked we not in the same steps.\"\n\"if it be yet in vain.\"\n\"then is the offence of the cross ceased.\"\n\"or the son of man that thou visitest him.\"\n\"was it not with them that had sinned whose carcases fell in the wilderness.\"\n\"because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.\"\n\"can faith save him.\"\n\"either a vine figs.\"\n\"so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.\"\n\"let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.\"\n\"come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members.\"\n\"let him pray.\"\n\"let him sing psalms.\"\n\"for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.\"\n\"and whence came they.\"\n\"for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.\"\n\"who is able to make war with him.\"\n\"for thou only art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifest.\"\n\"for in one hour is thy judgment come.\"\n\"for in one hour is she made desolate.\"\n\"and we declare that approaching near to it is another thing namely progress or improvement.\"\n\"and what the use of his arms and of the strength of the other parts of his body and his endurance and noble spirit if such circumstances and occasions had not roused and exercised him.\"\n\"or must he sometimes withdraw from it but admit the consequences and not admit contradictions.\"\n\"it is plain that he who has been exercised in the perfect syllogism must be equally expert in the imperfect also.\"\n\"and particularly as this would not only be an occupation which would withdraw us from more necessary things but would also be a cause of self conceit and arrogance and no small cause.\"\n\"where does there remain any room for tears.\"\n\"and where is there occasion for flattery.\"\n\"why shall one man envy another.\"\n\"why should a man admire the rich or the powerful even if they be both very strong and of violent temper.\"\n\"for what will they do to us.\"\n\"the first thing for me is to sleep.\"\n\"he said.\"\n\"and so should the child have been left alone and without help on account of the great affection of you the parents and of those about her or should she have died in the hands of those who neither loved her nor cared for her.\"\n\"or for this reason would you rather pray if it were possible to be loved by your enemies and deserted by them.\"\n\"and how is that possible.\"\n\"and how is it possible.\"\n\"let him be a bad son and lament.\"\n\"let him be a bad father.\"\n\"but toward the laws of the gods you are not looking.\"\n\"and when to shed the leaves do they shed the leaves.\"\n\"how much more beautiful than the cocks comb how much more becoming than the lions mane.\"\n\"for it is plain that this should be done either by itself or by another thing.\"\n\"and what more have you need of.\"\n\"and how are you so peevish.\"\n\"for we only lose those things we have only pains about those things which we possess.\"\n\"the leg.\"\n\"the neck.\"\n\"the will.\"\n\"and what if there should be great heat.\"\n\"and what if it is in the dark.\"\n\"what if it should be a little reputation or abuse and what if it should be praise and what if it should be death.\"\n\"is it the tyrant and his guards.\"\n\"that a man should neglect himself and his own interest.\"\n\"for having acted conformably to nature.\"\n\"then indeed many words are necessary.\"\n\"and why do you light your lamp and labor for us and write so many books.\"\n\"is it that we may not be ignorant of the truth who we are and what we are with respect to you.\"\n\"do you not admit that what is good ought to be done.\"\n\"and are not children and parents and country.\"\n\"is it possible then when a man sustains damage and does not obtain good things that he can be happy.\"\n\"that we should be as silly as sheep.\"\n\"but not even do they desert their offspring or as savage as wolves but not even do wolves desert their young.\"\n\"just as we call the bed in the inn.\"\n\"who else than yourself will hinder you from using them.\"\n\"when you seek what is not your own you lose that which is your own.\"\n\"and what is more paradoxical than to puncture a mans eye in order that he may see.\"\n\"but if it can he taught teach me and if you cannot allow me to learn from those who say that they know how to teach.\"\n\"and if such a man blames any one does the man care for the blame.\"\n\"and if he praises any one is the man elated when in such small matters as an hypothetical syllogism he who praises cannot see what is consequent on the hypothesis.\"\n\"the master of what.\"\n\"see you are dragged to prison you are going to be beheaded.\"\n\"who is judged in this case.\"\n\"who has been condemned.\"\n\"the hypothetical syllogism or the man who has been deceived by it.\"\n\"this the men of the bedchamber.\"\n\"this the armed guards.\"\n\"for if these things are true which have been often said and often proved that the nature of good is in the use of appearances and the nature of evil likewise and that things independent of our will do not admit either the nature of evil nor of good what paradox do the philosophers assert if they say that where things are not dependent on the will there you should employ confidence but where they are dependent on the will there you should employ caution.\"\n\"for if it is not separated now it will be separated afterward.\"\n\"is not money your master or a girl or a boy or some tyrant or some friend of the tyrant.\"\n\"why do you tremble then when you are going off to any trial of this kind.\"\n\"who shall compel you to avoid what you do not think fit to avoid.\"\n\"what will he write.\"\n\"for my part is done.\"\n\"for they are not separated from communion with other things.\"\n\"and what kind of danger is yours if others have false opinions.\"\n\"do you not know the evils which hold me.\"\n\"for if it is not there you not choose to say that it exists in any other thing.\"\n\"will you not remember when you are eating who you are who eat and whom you feed.\"\n\"and do you seek for any other when you have him.\"\n\"or the work in the one case like the other.\"\n\"a supercilious countenance.\"\n\"and if you shall lose modesty moderation and gentleness do you think the loss nothing.\"\n\"is he deprived of nothing does he part with nothing of the things which belong to him.\"\n\"natural affection a natural disposition to help others a natural disposition to forbearance.\"\n\"who among us defers the use of them till he has learned them as he defers the use of the words about lines or sounds.\"\n\"why more than what seems right to me or to any other man.\"\n\"and what envy is there of evils.\"\n\"for it is not likely that you who are so wise a man and have a reputation in the city inconsiderately and carelessly allow the most valuable thing that you possess to be neglected and to perish.\"\n\"is it not because you have practiced writing the name.\"\n\"and why.\"\n\"and what else did you learn in the school.\"\n\"was it not for the purpose of discoursing skillfully.\"\n\"and is not discoursing skillfully the same as discoursing seasonably and cautiously and with intelligence and also without making mistakes and without hindrance and besides all this with confidence.\"\n\"for what is greater and more useful than for you to be persuaded that it is not sufficient to have made your determination and not to change it.\"\n\"has he not given to you magnanimity.\"\n\"has he not given to you manliness.\"\n\"who when he is deliberating cares about his own deliberation and not about obtaining that about which he deliberates.\"\n\"have you anything better or greater to see than the sun the moon the stars the whole earth the sea.\"\n\"will you sit and weep like children.\"\n\"what did you hear what did you learn.\"\n\"is it any other than that a man cannot properly adapt the preconception of health to particulars.\"\n\"why are you unhappy.\"\n\"how then shall it be done.\"\n\"who shall compel you.\"\n\"he will be more trifling and impertinent than he is now for what else have you rained by reading it.\"\n\"we are perishing and you come to mock us.\"\n\"what is the matter about which you are engaged.\"\n\"my own evils are enough for me.\"\n\"and why do you put on a guise which does not belong to you and walk about being thieves and pilferers of these names and things which do not belong to you.\"\n\"or on the other hand how can an olive tree be moved not in the manner of an olive tree but in the manner of a vine.\"\n\"when a man has received from nature measures and rules for the knowing of truth and does not strive to add to these measures and rules and to improve them but just the contrary endeavors to take away and destroy whatever enables us to discern the truth.\"\n\"piety and sanctity what do you think that they are.\"\n\"are you refuting yourself every day and will you not give up these frigid attempts.\"\n\"to your mouth or to your eye.\"\n\"when you wash yourself what do you go into.\"\n\"do you ever call a pot a dish or a ladle a spit.\"\n\"he would say.\"\n\"who comes to present his opinions to he purified.\"\n\"who comes to learn what he is in want of.\"\n\"for this do you sit by my side.\"\n\"did you ever for this light your lamp or keep awake.\"\n\"or when you went out to the walkingplace did you ever propose any appearance that had been presented to you instead of a syllogism and did you and your friends discuss it together.\"\n\"a man may say am foolish and yet love my child.\"\n\"do you not distinguish appearances.\"\n\"do you not use food which is suitable for your body and clothing and habitation.\"\n\"and do you not think the same men at one time to be good at another time bad.\"\n\"and have you not at one time a friendly feeling toward them and at another time the feeling of an enemy.\"\n\"and do you not at one time praise them and at another time blame them.\"\n\"but that you may know what friendship is throw a bit of flesh among them and you will learn.\"\n\"that he was not in agony when the child had a fever.\"\n\"then when the test the thing came and was near see what words they utter.\"\n\"and to no purpose has he infused into them a spirit so strong and of such skillful contrivance as to reach a long way and to fashion the forms of things which are seen.\"\n\"or the faculty of hearing.\"\n\"or wheat or barley or a horse or a dog.\"\n\"who answers you.\"\n\"for which of them knows what itself is and what is its own value.\"\n\"which of them knows when it ought to employ itself and when not.\"\n\"what faculty is it which opens and closes the eyes and turns them away from objects to which it ought not to apply them and does apply them to other objects.\"\n\"what is that by which they are curious and inquisitive or on the contrary unmoved by what is said.\"\n\"is it the faculty of hearing.\"\n\"and are you not mad.\"\n\"are you in fact so blind and deaf.\"\n\"and how many meadows are pleasant.\"\n\"yet only passing through.\"\n\"but only as being a way home as inns are.\"\n\"for though it is small it is still a little ass.\"\n\"does not the one say that he ought to take the prize of another and does not the other say that he ought not.\"\n\"to gain mistresses or to fight.\"\n\"and do you become worse than a wellbehaved priest who treats you these fine gladiators with all respect.\"\n\"and he did not comb it elegantly nor dress it.\"\n\"how he stopped their mouths.\"\n\"did he so much despair of me.\"\n\"and how many other young men at this age commit many like errors.\"\n\"and how does it concern you how we act.\"\n\"and what is it that you say.\"\n\"where shall we exhibit him.\"\n\"and under what name shall we show him.\"\n\"was it fit that nature should make all human creatures women.\"\n\"and what advantage in that case would you have had in being adorned.\"\n\"for whom would you have adorned yourself if all human creatures were women.\"\n\"and if women took delight in catamites would you become one.\"\n\"were you born for this purpose that dissolute women should delight in you.\"\n\"but some propitious good through him for it would never have come into his thoughts to say this since he is not accustomed to talk thus with any person.\"\n\"he has only the first principles and no more.\"\n\"and what will people think of you.\"\n\"for if it is not right to show partisanship in this way do not do so yourself and if it is right why are you angry if they followed your example.\"\n\"do not the sailors abuse him.\"\n\"he knows that if he punished all who abuse him he would have nobody to rule over.\"\n\"you are not saying what you say on account of your father or your brother but on account of yourself do you still allege your sickness.\"\n\"the husbandman while he is tilling the ground the sailor while he is on his voyage.\"\n\"what would you be doing when death surprises you for you must be surprised when you are doing something.\"\n\"in using nice little words.\"\n\"to have blamed nobody.\"\n\"to carry the same face always in going out and coming in.\"\n\"for if indeed you had it you would both be content in sickness and in hunger and in death.\"\n\"for if it shall depend on things of the soul the substance of the good is discovered for good cannot be one thing and that at which we are rationally delighted another thing nor if that which precedes is not good can that which comes after be good for in order that the thing which comes after may be good that which precedes must be good.\"\n\"and if the husband foolishly prates about the matter why not pitch him out of the house.\"\n\"whence will the citizens come.\"\n\"who will bring them up.\"\n\"who will be governor of the youth who preside wi over gymnastic exercises.\"\n\"and in what also will the teacher instruct them.\"\n\"the silver or the workmanship.\"\n\"what other is capable of receiving the appearance of shame.\"\n\"and we are so constituted by nature as to subject pleasure to these things as a minister a servant in order that it may call forth our activity in order that it may keep us constant in acts which are conformable to nature.\"\n\"whose hand did you kiss.\"\n\"because he has made you capable of endurance.\"\n\"because he has made you magnanimous.\"\n\"because he has taken from that which befalls you the power of being evil.\"\n\"because it is in your power to be happy while you are suffering what you suffer because he has opened the door to you when things do not please you.\"\n\"and did you not then as you do all things now do as you did do.\"\n\"and when you were become a youth and attended the rhetoricians and yourself practiced rhetoric what did you imagine that you were deficient in.\"\n\"does it need only a short time.\"\n\"and is it possible to seize it as you pass by.\"\n\"but it is something to you.\"\n\"who shall hinder you.\"\n\"if you walk about well you have all that belongs to a man who walks.\"\n\"and when you were in health what good was that to you.\"\n\"is it that you are near the severance of the soul and the body.\"\n\"what harm is there in this.\"\n\"so far as not to be careless about them.\"\n\"where is there then still reason for anger and of fear about what belongs to others about things which are of no value.\"\n\"what want.\"\n\"why do we make ourselves worse than children.\"\n\"and what do children do when they are left alone.\"\n\"what are you doing.\"\n\"have you been useful to yourself.\"\n\"and some according to a fixed scheme of life.\"\n\"according to nature or contrary to nature.\"\n\"would he not have gained the opposite.\"\n\"would he not have gained the name of coward ignoble a hater of his country a man who feared death.\"\n\"and it will be of gold.\"\n\"and shall it not even do me good.\"\n\"will it not be an advantage.\"\n\"and shall they who undertake this work come to it with success.\"\n\"these things are done both in due place and in due time and when accompanied with sacrifice and prayers when a man is first purified and when he is disposed in his mind to the thought that he is going to approach sacred rites and ancient rites.\"\n\"why are you careless.\"\n\"why do you undertake a thing that is in no way fit for you.\"\n\"when then a man fears these things is it possible for him to be bold with his whole soul to superintend men.\"\n\"like blind people you are wandering up and down you are going by another road and have left the true road you seek for prosperity and happiness where they are not and if another shows you where they are you do not believe him.\"\n\"you who from without see their affairs and are dazzled by an appearance or the men themselves.\"\n\"was your aversion.\"\n\"was your movement.\"\n\"was your avoidance of things.\"\n\"do you not imagine it to be free from harm.\"\n\"in that which serves or in that which is free.\"\n\"and how is a thing great or valuable which is naturally dead or earth or mud.\"\n\"did any of you ever see me with sorrowful countenance.\"\n\"because he maintains a decency of behavior because he displays his virtue more conspicuously.\"\n\"or rather he thought that there was no comparison between them.\"\n\"whose duty it is to look after others the married and those who have children to see who uses his wife well who uses her badly who quarrels what family is well administered what is not going about as a physician does and feels pulses.\"\n\"is it not his duty to supply clothing to his children and to send them to the schoolmaster with writing tablets and styles.\"\n\"are you the bull of the herd or the queen of the bees.\"\n\"and he says well for it is of no value to a musician so far as he is a musician nor to a geometrician.\"\n\"in what.\"\n\"tell us that we may run to your audienceroom.\"\n\"and did you not flatter a certain person who was the son of a senator.\"\n\"do not these very people secretly despise you.\"\n\"has he been turned to reflect on himself.\"\n\"has he perceived in what a bad state he is.\"\n\"has he cast away selfconceit.\"\n\"does he look for a person to teach him.\"\n\"ought a man to listen to such things without pleasure.\"\n\"when you are uttering your exclamations.\"\n\"is there not the hortatory
